<h1>ChangeLog</h1>

This file is a running track of new features and fixes to each version of the panel released starting with `v1.6.3`.

<h2>v1.6.5</h2>

<h3>Changed</h3>

- Updated `Flanco Theme` for the `1.8.1` version of the panel (Thanks
  for [MonkeySaint](https://github.com/MonkeySaint/Flanco-Theme)).

- The `Dracula`, `Enola` and `Twilight` themes have been made obsolete in the new `1.9.0` version of the panel, so they
  only work for `1.7.0` and `1.8.1`.

<h2>v1.6.4</h2>

<h3>Changed</h3>

- Update the supported versions that were forgotten.

<h2>v1.6.3</h2>

<h3>Added</h3>

- The `Dracula`, `Enola` and `Twilight` themes will always work for the newest versions of the panel, so a function that
  detects the version automatically has been made only for these themes.

<h3>Changed</h3>

- The `BackgroundVideo` theme have been updated to the new panel version `v1.8.1`.

<h3>Note</h3>

- The rest of the themes need to be updated by their original authors.
